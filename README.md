# libft

## What is Libft?

At _42_, students are not allowed to use standard C functions. Therefore, they must re-create _libc_ functions and also create new additional functions needed to write complex programs. __Libft__ is the project for this purpose.

## Usage

``make`` without bonus functions.

``make bonus`` to compile with bonuses.
